<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I am assuming that you already cloned some project using Github web. You should also configure your local repository to have 2 remotes:<br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>origin - this one is created by default and points to your cloned Github project</li><li>upstream - this one should point to development branch of the original project. Use following command:<br /><code class="plain">git remote add upstream https://github.com/midgetspy/Sick-Beard.git</code></li></ol><br />Following command will create branch in which you will be doing your changes. Newly created branch will be used in pull request later:<br /><code class="plain">git checkout -b your_branch_name upstream/development_branch</code><br /><br />Following command will push your changes to your Github cloned repository:<br /><code class="plain">git push -u origin your_branch_name</code><br /><br />And now you can create pull request using Github web from your branch to the original project. </div>
