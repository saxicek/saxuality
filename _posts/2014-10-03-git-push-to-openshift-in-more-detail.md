Ever wondered what happens when you push your changes to OpenShift? Here is the
sweet secret - OpenShift runs:

```
gear deploy
```

Now you can retry execution of your push if something failed on the way. For
further information about build process you can also check documentation -
<http://openshift.github.io/documentation/oo_cartridge_developers_guide.html#openshift-builds>.
