Sometimes you are not directly connected to the Internet. Following commands are used to setup HTTP and HTTPS proxy in NPM:
```
npm config set proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
npm config set https-proxy http://proxy.company.com:8080
```

To unset the configuration run:
```
npm config rm proxy
npm config rm https-proxy
```
