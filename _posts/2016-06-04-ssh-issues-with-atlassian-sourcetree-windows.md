If your Git repository configured over SSH fails with:

```
FATAL ERROR: Server unexpectedly closed network connection
```

Check your sshd server security settings. I found out that `MACs hmac-sha1` is
required by SourceTree.

I am using Synology and when setup with high security level of algorithms
SourceTree cannot negotiate connection (while Putty/Plink normally works). Check
your `/var/log/auth.log` - mine has folloging errors:

```
sshd[23561]: fatal: ssh_dispatch_run_fatal: no matching MAC found [preauth]
```
