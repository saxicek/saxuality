Today I played with <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> and on the server side used JPA (Java Persistence API). As I'm developing my project using Netbeans platform, I just created new GWT project, added persistence and imported entity classes from MySQL database. As a persistence unit I used TopLink.<br />Now the problem raised when I deployed the project on the server: I got exceptions from TopLink - No persistence provider.<br />After some googling I finally found answer how to solve this:<br />copy mysql library (<code>mysql-connector-java-5.1.5-bin.jar</code>) to your Glassfish domain lib dir (<code>\glassfish-v2ur2\domains\domain1\lib\ext\</code>) and TopLink should stop complaining.
