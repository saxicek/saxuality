IE7 is not supported by TestDirector 8.0. But that's what you know already. And nobody wants to downgrade IE. ;-)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Solution:</span><br />Download standalone IE and send a threatening mail to your manager that this piece of software sucks. Anyways - I used <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/browsers/multipleie.html">http://www.quirksmode.org/browsers/multipleie.html</a>  - version 5.5SP2. I hope this helps.
