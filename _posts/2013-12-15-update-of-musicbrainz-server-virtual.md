Once again I tried to update my Musicbrainz virtual machine image to version 2013-12-09 and experienced errors (again). Following are high level step which may help you to overcome the issues:

- Dependencies changed. Running recommended `cpanm --installdeps --notest .`
  fails with error on some dependencies. Check the errors and install
  dependencies manually with `cpanm`. For example
  `cpanm Apache::LogFormat::Compile`.

- Old way of server startup `carton exec -- plackup -Ilib -r` does not seem to
  be working any more. Use `plackup -Ilib -r` instead.
