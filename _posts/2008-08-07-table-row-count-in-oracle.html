You can get some row_count statistics directly from user_tables but they are not always accurate. So I wrote a script that counts number of lines.<br /><pre><br />DECLARE<br />  pl_count NUMBER;<br />BEGIN<br />  FOR rec IN (SELECT table_name FROM user_tables ORDER BY table_name) LOOP<br />    BEGIN<br />      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'select count(*) from ' || rec.table_name<br />        INTO pl_count;<br />      dbms_output.put_line(rec.table_name || ' ' || pl_count);<br />    EXCEPTION<br />      WHEN OTHERS THEN<br />        NULL;<br />    END;<br />  END LOOP;<br />END;<br />/<br /></pre><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Note: Before running please consider your database size as the script can run very long if there is a large amount of data.</span>
